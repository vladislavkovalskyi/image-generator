# Image server GoLang
This proj is built so you can hit up a `Go` server to slap some text on images and get the generated pics back.
It needs some scaling up, but i threw it together for my own needs

### Run
* `go mod tidy`
* `go run main.go`
* `python -m pip install requests`
* `python make_request.py`
